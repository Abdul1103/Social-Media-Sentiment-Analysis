## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on social media posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.  
The goal is to classify text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiment.

The project includes data cleaning, text preprocessing, feature engineering using TF-IDF, model training, and evaluating performance using ML metrics.

## Problem Statement
With millions of tweets and online posts generated daily, understanding public opinion at scale is challenging.  
 This project helps automate opinion mining by analyzing the sentiment behind social media text.

---

## Objectives
- Preprocess and clean raw tweet text  
- Apply NLP techniques for feature extraction  
- Train ML models for sentiment classification  
- Evaluate model performance using statistical metrics  
- Predict sentiment for custom user-input text  

---

## Features
- Complete text cleaning pipeline  
- Stopword removal, tokenization, stemming  
- TF-IDF vectorization  
- Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes models  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Predict sentiment for new text  
- Optional: visualization of sentiment distribution
